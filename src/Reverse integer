Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

public class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int result = 0;

        while (x != 0)
        {
            int tail = x % 10;
            int newResult = result * 10 + tail;
            if ((newResult - tail) / 10 != result)
            { return 0; }
            result = newResult;
            x = x / 10;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
